# Destinator

Personalized recommendations of places to explore in British Columbia based on TripAdvisor reviews.

The idea is to train embeddings based on reviews only and use them to search similar places and do content-based personalization.

Stack:
- Python FastAPI for backend
- React.js web app with Google Maps
- Elastic Search to store data, embeddings and search
- Gensim and Spacy for embeddings and tags
